# E-Commerce-Customer-Churn-Analysis

An E Commerce company provider is facing a lot of competition in the current market and it has  become a challenge to retain the existing customers in the current situation. Hence, the  company wants to develop a model through which they can do churn prediction of the  accounts and provide segmented offers to the potential churners.

You have been assigned to develop a churn prediction model for this company and provide  
business recommendations on the campaign.  
Your campaign suggestion should be unique and be very clear on the campaign offer because  
your recommendation will go through the revenue assurance team. If they find that you are  
giving a lot of free (or subsidized) stuff thereby making a loss to the company; they are not 
going to approve your recommendation.
